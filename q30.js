// getInitialState(): This is executed before the creation of the component.
// componentDidMount(): Is executed when the component gets rendered and placed on the DOM.
// shouldComponentUpdate(): Is invoked when a component determines changes to the DOM and returns a “true” or “false” value based on certain conditions.
// componentDidUpdate(): Is invoked immediately after rendering takes place.
// componentWillUnmount(): Is invoked immediately before a component is destroyed and unmounted permanently.
