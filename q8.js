// What is an event in React?
// An event is an action that a user or system may trigger, such as pressing a key, a mouse click, etc.

// React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase in HTML.
// With JSX, you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string in HTML.

<Button onPress={lightItUp} />
