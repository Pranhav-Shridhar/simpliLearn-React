// How do you create a React app?

// These are the steps for creating a React app:

// 1. Install NodeJS on the computer because we need npm to install the React library. Npm is the node package manager that contains many JavaScript libraries, including React.

// 2. Install the create-react-app package using the command prompt or terminal.
// 3. Install a text editor of your choice, like VS Code or Sublime Text.
// 4. Run npx create-react-app my-app command where you want to create the app
// 5. After finishing the app run cd my-app to move into the PromiseRejectionEvent
// 6. Run npm start to start the app.
